# Eeg Graph Analysis
Graph analysis of resting state eeg data using MNE and Networkx

Resting state data are cleaned and a connectivity matrix is created using the phase lag index (PLI).
We can then build a graph and describe it using the classical measures or construct an acyclic sub network (Minimum spanning tree) that can be descripted with measures that allows unbiased group comparisons.
